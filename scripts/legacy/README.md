# Legacy Scripts

These scripts are from the pre-Tauri era of Tepora (or "Web Mode").
They are preserved for development reference or running the app in a purely web-based environment without the Desktop wrapper.

- `start_app.bat`: Legacy entry point.
- `start_backend.bat`: Python backend launcher.
- `start_frontend.bat`: Vite frontend launcher.

**Note**: The primary way to run Tepora is now via `npm run tauri dev` or the built desktop executable.
